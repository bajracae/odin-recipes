    <h1>Mashed Potatoes</h1>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      One of the best vegetables of mankind mashed up is the best. This dish is
      a must for Thanksgiving as it serves a really good side with a turkey or
      ham. I'm salivating just thinking about it.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds baking potatoes, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, peeled, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and garlic,
        lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a small
        saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture,
        blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes are
        smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper. Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
